    <b>Hacking:    </b> Hacking is an attempt to exploit a <i>computer system or a private network </i>inside a computer. Simply put, it is the
    <font style="color: red;"> unauthorised access</font> to or control over computer network security <br> systems for some illicit purpose. ... They can destroy, steal or even prevent authorized users from accessing the system.
    <br><br><br>

    <b>Python:    </b>Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike <i>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, </i>it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development,
    software development,
    <font style="color: red;"> data science</font> and writing system scripts among other things.

    <br><br><br><br>
    <b>Life Cycle:</b> A <i>life cycle</i> is a course of events that brings a new product into existence and follows its growth into a mature product and eventual critical mass and decline. The most common steps in the life<br> cycle of a product include
    product development, market introduction, growth, maturity, and decline/stability.
    <br><br><br><br>
    <b>Internet:</b> A <i>global computer network providing </i>a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
